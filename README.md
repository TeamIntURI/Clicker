Clicker
=======

The CSC305 Android Clicker Application


Updates will be pushed and ALWAYS commented so we can all see what we are working on. Please do not work on multiple aspects
without informing each other team member. It would suck for someone to be working on a piece (UI for example) and all of their
changes are imediately overwritten. 

If you guys have issues trying to access the repository look up some guides online. This should be set for right now. 

Try to connect to this ASAP before I go on vacation. 

Thanks,
Andrew
